Hey there ðŸ‘‹ ! 

Iâ€™m a cybersecurity enthusiast and engineering student currently based in France.

I have a strong interest in **offensive security**. When Iâ€™m not working on projects, youâ€™ll find me solving challenges on platforms like **Root-Me** or participating in CTF competitions.

I enjoy testing and improving my skills through hands-on practice and experimentation.

## Background

- **Work-Study at CEA**: Cybersecurity engineer at the French Atomic Energy Commission for 2 years.
- **Internship Cybersecurity**: Worked on the analysis and security of software protection solutions, including developing a bruteforce tool in Rust.
- **Master in Cybersecurity**: Currently completing an MSc in Cybersecurity with a specialization in embedded systems.
- **Bachelor Degree**: Three years studying the fundamentals of computer science.

## Projects & Contributions

Iâ€™ve developed tools and shared insights:
- **[Ghidrautorename](https://github.com/sneaXOR/Ghidrautorename)**: A tool that automates function renaming in Ghidra using strings from binaries.
- Various other tools available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/sneaXOR).
